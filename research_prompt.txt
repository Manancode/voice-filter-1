COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH PROMPT FOR ONNX CONFORMER ATTENTION MASK HARDCODING ISSUE

CONTEXT:
I am converting a PyTorch Conformer-based voice filter model (ConVoiFilter) to ONNX format for Android deployment. The model is from HuggingFace: nguyenvulebinh/voice-filter. The model uses a Conformer architecture with attention mechanisms.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
During ONNX export, the attention masks in the Conformer's self-attention layers are being hardcoded with fixed dimensions (1000 time steps) instead of being dynamic. This causes broadcasting errors when trying to run the ONNX model with different input sequence lengths.

SPECIFIC ERROR:
RuntimeException: ... Where node. ... Attempting to broadcast an axis by a dimension other than 1. 1000 by 4627

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- Model: Conformer-based voice filter with 4 encoder layers
- ONNX export shows constants with shape [1, 1, 1, 1000] for attention masks
- These are in nodes like: /separator/conformer/encoders/encoders.0/self_attn/Constant_45
- The Where nodes in attention mechanism are trying to broadcast between hardcoded 1000 and actual sequence length (e.g., 4627)
- Using PyTorch 1.13.1, ONNX opset 17, dynamic_axes properly set

6. **Are there alternative voice filter models that work better with ONNX?**
   - Models with simpler attention mechanisms?
   - Models already optimized for ONNX?
   - Models with similar performance but better ONNX compatibility?

7. **What's the best approach for production deployment?**
