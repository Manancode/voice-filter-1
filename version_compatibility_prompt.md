# Detailed Research Prompt for Version Compatibility Issues

## Context
I'm trying to convert a PyTorch Conformer-based voice filter model (ConVoiFilter from HuggingFace: nguyenvulebinh/voice-filter) to ONNX format. The model uses ESPnet framework and HuggingFace Transformers.

## Current Error
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Inf' from 'numpy' (/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy/__init__.py)
```

This error occurs when trying to import:
```python
from src.model.modeling_enh import VoiceFilter
```

## Error Chain Analysis
1. The import chain is: `VoiceFilter` → `transformers.PreTrainedModel` → `transformers.modeling_utils` → `transformers.loss.loss_utils` → `transformers.loss.loss_d_fine` → `transformers.loss.loss_for_object_detection` → `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` → `scipy.optimize._optimize` → `numpy.Inf`

2. The issue is in `scipy.optimize._optimize.py` line 30:
```python
from numpy import (atleast_1d, eye, argmin, zeros, shape, squeeze,
                   asarray, sqrt, Inf, asfarray)
```

## Specific Questions to Research

### 1. NumPy Version Compatibility
- **When was `numpy.Inf` deprecated/removed?** 
- **What versions of NumPy still have `numpy.Inf`?**
- **What should be used instead of `numpy.Inf` in newer NumPy versions?**
- **What's the exact NumPy version where this breaking change occurred?**

### 2. SciPy Version Compatibility  
- **What versions of SciPy are compatible with NumPy 1.24.3?**
- **What versions of SciPy still use `numpy.Inf`?**
- **What's the latest SciPy version that works with older NumPy versions?**
- **What's the minimum SciPy version that fixes the `numpy.Inf` import issue?**

### 3. Transformers Library Compatibility
- **What versions of HuggingFace Transformers are compatible with NumPy 1.24.3 and SciPy 1.10.1?**
- **Are there known compatibility issues between Transformers and specific NumPy/SciPy versions?**
- **What's the recommended NumPy/SciPy/Transformers version combination for ESPnet models?**

### 4. ESPnet Framework Compatibility
- **What NumPy/SciPy versions does ESPnet officially support?**
- **Are there known compatibility issues between ESPnet and newer NumPy/SciPy versions?**
- **What's the recommended environment setup for ESPnet models?**

### 5. Alternative Solutions
- **Can we patch the SciPy code to use `numpy.inf` instead of `numpy.Inf`?**
- **Are there environment variables or configuration options to avoid this import?**
- **Can we use a different import path that doesn't trigger this issue?**

### 6. Specific Version Combinations
- **What's the exact working combination of:**
  - NumPy version
  - SciPy version  
  - Transformers version
  - ESPnet version
  - PyTorch version
  - Python version (3.10)

## Research Sources to Check
1. **NumPy release notes** - When was `Inf` removed?
2. **SciPy release notes** - When did they update to use `inf` instead of `Inf`?
3. **Transformers GitHub issues** - Search for "numpy Inf" or "scipy optimize" compatibility issues
4. **ESPnet documentation** - Official supported versions
5. **Stack Overflow** - Similar import errors and solutions
6. **GitHub issues** - Search for "ImportError: cannot import name 'Inf' from 'numpy'"

## Expected Outcome
I need the exact version numbers that work together without conflicts, or a specific fix/patch that resolves this import issue while maintaining compatibility with the ConVoiFilter model.

## Additional Context
- This is for converting a 2-year-old model to ONNX
- The original model was trained with older library versions
- We need to maintain compatibility with the model's expected environment
- The goal is to get ONNX files for Android deployment
